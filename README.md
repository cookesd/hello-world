# hello-world
First GitHub Repository
Beginning to use GitHub because it may be useful as I learn to code.
I haven't taken many formal programming classes so I would like to learn some best practices.
I was a math major and am an Operations Research Analyst so programming
will be very useful fo practical applications.
